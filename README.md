INFO 343 Autumn 2017 Group 5

Product:
    Our team will build a dating web app for college students. It will allow them to fill out a form with preferences of who       they would like to be matched with (i.e. sex, location, hobbies, etc.), and they will recieve pages of profile cards of       matches ranked on order of match compatibility. Users can then click on and view their match's profile, and start a           conversation with a live in-app chat box.
